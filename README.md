# Hi there fellow traveller!
	CSS, though it may not be a handful to other people and could even be underestimated once merely sratching the surface (I admit to that) is a humungous pain in the **ASS**

	Especially when paired with html while learning front-end, such a deception!

## I will now be readying for JavaScript 
	Even if I'm quite familiar with the basics of it, this language has a plethora of applications may it be back-end or front-end dev and could be confusing to learn.  

##### This will once again, probably, test my sanity...
